<p>Former Indy 500 racecar driver, AT user and philanthropist <a href=""http://www.resna.org/conference/program/opening-plenary-session.dot?host_id=1"">Sam Schmidt</a> will open the conference on Friday, June 13th. Mr. Schmidt is an entrepreneur, speaker, and founding owner of Sam Schmidt Motorsports and the Sam Schmidt Paralysis Foundation. A terrible racecar driving crash on June 6, 2000, resulted in him becoming a person with quadriplegia. He continues to pursue his passion for the sport through his company, which has become the most successful racecar team in the history of the Firestone Indy Light Series, winning seven series championships. Through his foundation, Mr. Schmidt is spearheading a major research project to spark collaboration on an international level among researchers from various scientific fields to find cures and treatments for paralysis.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.resna.org/conference/program/saturday-plenary-session-.dot?host_id=1"">Dr. Gregor Wolbring</a> is an internationally known scholar and researcher in the areas of ability and ableism ethics and governance, based at the University of Calgary. (Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against persons with disabilities; broadly, ableists believe that the able-bodied are the norm in society, and that people with disabilities should strive to become that norm.) Dr. Wolbring is particularly interested in the variety of issues surrounding new and emerging technologies and how those affect people with disabilities. He appears in the new documentary <a href=""http://www.fixedthemovie.com/"">&ldquo;Fixed: The Science/Fiction of Human Enhancement,&rdquo;</a> which is winning awards on the film festival circuit. Dr. Wolbring will be the plenary speaker on Saturday morning, June 14th. The film will screen at the conference that evening, followed by a question and answer session with Dr. Wolbring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.resna.org/conference/program/sunday-plenary-session.dot?host_id=1"">Dr. Cole Galloway</a>, a leading researcher in pediatric mobility through his &ldquo;Go, Baby, Go&rdquo; project at the University of Delaware, is the plenary speaker on Sunday, June 15th. Dr. Galloway has been instrumental in changing people&rsquo;s minds about the appropriate age for children to begin using power wheelchairs, arguing that toddlers can safely and reasonably use power mobility. His groundbreaking research shows that independent mobility and pediatric development are closely linked, and he is the co-inventor of the UD1, a kid-sized robot that provides mobility to children with special needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Covering almost every area of assistive technology solutions for people with disabilities, the annual RESNA (Rehabilitation Engineering &amp; Assistive Technology Society of North America) conference will take place June 13 -15 at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis, IN. &nbsp;Prior to the start of the conference, there will be two days of instructional courses (June 11 and 12), including the popular &ldquo;Fundamentals in Assistive Technology,&rdquo; an introductory course for those just entering the field or for&nbsp; professionals who wish to broaden their knowledge base. The conference also includes a large exhibit hall, a Developer&rsquo;s Forum, student design and scientific paper competitions, research platform and poster presentations, and several social events.</p>

<p>During this pre-conference session, the CanWheel team will introduce themselves,&nbsp;provide an overview of each project, and describe their interdisciplinary approach to enhance the health, functioning and quality of life of older adult power wheelchair (PWC) users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About CanWheel</b></p>
<p>Power wheelchairs (PWCs) are a form of assistive technology that can compensate for impaired mobility and improve quality of life for older adults. These devices can have a positive impact on the quality of life of older adults, including improved well-being and self-esteem, reduced pain and discomfort, and enhanced activity performance, participation and independence. Despite these benefits, PWCs are far from perfect in terms of their functionality, safety, and cost-effectiveness &ndash; which make them among the most frequently abandoned devices by their users.&nbsp; If the hope is to reduce wheelchair abandonment issues and aid older adults in accessing the benefits of their devices, it is important to understand how PWCs can better meet users&rsquo; needs and skill levels. It was for these reasons that the&nbsp;<b>CanWheel </b>research team was formed.</p>
<p>The CanWheel team is comprised of over 15 clinical researchers and scientists across Canada with expertise in assistive technology, mobility and impairment. In 2009, the team was awarded a Canadian Institute of Health Research Emerging Team grant (AMG-109025), led by Dr. William Miller, PhD, FCAOT,&nbsp; Professor in the Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy at the University of British Columbia and Co-Director of the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute Rehabilitation Research Program at GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre. The CanWheel team consists of computer scientists, engineers, epidemiologists, gerontologists, occupational therapists, rehabilitation-medicine physicians and sociologists who share the common mission of improving the wheeled mobility of older adults.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of CanWheel is to improve the mobility opportunities of older adults who use PWCs by addressing three basic questions: 1) How are PWCs used now? 2) How can PWCs be used better?, and 3) How can PWCs be better?&nbsp; To answer these questions, the CanWheel team has developed a program of research that uses a mixed-methods approach, including lab-based, qualitative and quantitative methodologies, spanning five key research projects. The five research projects have been designed specifically to: 1) evaluate the needs and experiences of older adults using PWCs; &nbsp;2) describe the trajectory of mobility status in older PWC users with a toolkit of subjective and objective measures; 3) develop and assess innovations (e.g. collaborative PWC) to maintain and restore wheeled mobility; 4) monitor the activity level of the PWC users; and, 5) evaluate the Wheelchair Skills Training Program for PWC users.</p>

<p><img src=""/dotAsset/95594.jpg"" width=""149"" height=""149"" alt=""Student Seong-Hee with Josh Nelson of TREAT"" title=""Seong-Hee with Josh "" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;"" />At the time, Seong-Hee was a student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. She and her teammates&rsquo; idea was &ldquo;AlphaBraille,&rdquo; a game designed to teach children how to recognize Braille letters.&nbsp; Almost a year later, she found herself in Lebanon, New Hampshire, at TREAT&rsquo;s facility, meeting with a design team of engineers and discussing how to bring her idea to market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This opportunity was a real hands-on experience,&rdquo; said Seong-Hee. &ldquo;I not only discovered how to make the design more functional, I also received help in developing a business plan.&nbsp; I learned to go beyond being an engineer and become an entrepreneur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TREAT staff were also thrilled with how the internship turned out.&nbsp; Program Manager Joshua Nelson wasn&rsquo;t quite sure at first that it was going to work out. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t sure if Seong-Hee was going to take advantage of it, but when she finally arrived, she took to it like a fish to water,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Seong-Hee worked closely with an industrial designer at TREAT to revamp her design and make it more economical.&nbsp; &ldquo;I redesigned the electronics of the game to make it cheaper to produce,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I also made it compatible with a popular toy, Leapfrog, in order to appeal to a broader audience.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides a design focus, the TREAT internship includes everything a budding product designer needs to bring a product to market, such as help with setting up usability studies, marketing research, business plan development, and funding sources.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seong-Hee was able to do some intellectual property research while she was here, which led her to change the name of the product from &ldquo;AlphaBraille&rdquo; to &ldquo;Braille Bot,&rdquo; said Joshua. &ldquo;It makes the game sound much more appealing to the target market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The TREAT team even taught Seong-Hee how to make her product herself, so she can produce working prototypes to show to potential investors.&nbsp; &ldquo;They showed me how to cast mold polyurethane in my kitchen and my bathroom,&rdquo; she said proudly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Seong-Hee is now finishing up her business plan and investigating funding options through a possible Kickstarter campaign and contacting organizations that fund products for people with vision impairment.&nbsp; She is still in touch with the TREAT team, who continue to provide counsel and advice.&nbsp; Now graduated from school, she is working at biotech firm that she worked at during college while seeking more engineering opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The treaty, signed by President Obama in 2009, obligates ratifying nations to promote, protect, fulfill and ensure the rights of people with disabilities. Over 150 countries have already ratified the treaty, which has yet to pass the U.S. Senate. In a heartbreaking vote last December, the treaty fell just a few votes shy of ratification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter, signed by RESNA President Alex Mihailidis and Government Affairs Committee Chair Nathan Moon, states that with the passage of the American with Disabilities Act over two decades ago, ""...the United States has set an example for other nations to follow."" &nbsp;The letter points out that ""...RESNA members are involved with the development of international standards which ensure the safety and efficacy of technology for people with disabilities,"" and cites examples of wheelchair development projects in places like Central America, Thailand, and the nation of Georgia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Opening world markets to American-developed technology for people with disabilities is a win-win situation,"" something the Convention would make easier, and the letter concludes with ""We urge the members of your Committee and the full Senate to vote in favor of it.""</p>

<p>All of the student design semi-finalist teams presented their designs to the RESNA community of assistive technology professionals, rehabilitation engineers, clinicians, developers, and manufacturers at the conference.

<p>Governor Jay Inslee is expected to sign the bill, and the legislation will then take effect on January 1, 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The passage of the bill was the result of the efforts of a Washington CRT Work Group formed to pursue solutions to CRT issues within the state's Medicaid system. This approach follows work currently being done on the federal level to establish CRT recognition and make other CRT changes within Medicare <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.access2crt.org/access2crt/home"">(HR 942)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of the bill is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect access for complex need patients to important technology and supporting services</li>
<li>Establish and improve safeguards relating to the delivery and provision of medically necessary complex rehabilitation technology; and</li>
<li>Provide supports for complex need patients to stay in the home or community setting, prevent institutionalization, and prevent hospitalizations and other costly secondary complications.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>RESNA's ATP certification is explicity recognized within the bill's language, and establishes that each site owned by a supplier must employ at least one ATP ""to analyze the needs and capacities of complex needs patients, assist in selecting appropriate covered complex rehabilitation technology items for such needs and capacities, and provide training in the use of the selected covered complex rehabilitation technology items.""</p>
<p>According to an NCART press release, Don Clayback, NCART Executive Director, stated ""This is the first CRT recognition bill to be passed at the state level. It's encouraging to see another positive step in establishing greater CRT awareness with policymakers and protecting access for people with disabilities.""</p>

He is Course Director of Digital Interaction Design at the <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.dundee.ac.uk/"">University of Dundee</a> in Dundee, Scotland, where his research is exploring more expressive communication aids for people who cannot speak. His projects combine interaction design, Augmentative and Alternative Communication, phonetics, and critical design. He speak at the opening plenary session for <a class=""internal"" href=""http://www.resna.org/conference/"">RESNA 2013</a> on Saturday, June 22.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to joining the University of Dundee, Graham ran a multidisciplinary studio of user researchers, designers and engineers&nbsp;at the international design and innovation consultancy IDEO. He led projects out of London and San Francisco, from mobile phones for people in their 40s and 50s for Vodafone to concept hearing aids exhibited in the V&amp;A Museum.</p>
<p>Initially trained as an engineer, Graham worked at the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering on rehabilitation robotics.&nbsp;Seeing the potential of design in this context, he studied at the Royal College of Art, followed by extensive experience as an industrial designer and interaction designer, winning international awards for furniture for children with cerebral palsy and remote-controlled submarines.</p>
<p>Over 25 years involvement in both assistive technology and mainstream design informed and inspired <i>Design Meets Disability</i>. This manifesto&nbsp;argues for more art school-trained designers to be invited into disability-related design, in order to contribute not only their skills but also their sensibilities.

73953,Statement on the U.S. Senate's failure to ratify the CRPD treaty," MyHomePage, News,",,RESNA President Alex Mihailidis expresses "profound disappointment.",12/10/2012 10:19 AM,12/10/2012,12/10/2012 10:19 AM,0,"<p align=""center""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">STATEMENT FROM RESNA PRESIDENT ALEX MIHAILIDIS </span></p>
<p align=""center""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ON THE U.S. SENATE&rsquo;S FAILURE TO RATIFY THE CRPD TREATY</span></p>
<p align=""center""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br /></span></p>
<p>(Arlington, VA) &ndash; &ldquo;RESNA expresses its profound disappointment in the failure of the United States Senate to pass the resolution for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In over two decades since the Americans with Disabilities Act, progress has been made in advancing access and inclusion for people with disabilities, especially in the area of assistive technology. Although much work remains to be done, the United States has set an example for other nations to follow. The failure of the Convention in the Senate undermines these efforts. As a result, the US will be unable to join its partners around the world to promote equal access and inclusion for people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a North American organization, most of our members are from the US and Canada. However, many of our members are involved with international activities that assist people with disabilities in accessing and using the technology to participate in their local communities. RESNA members are involved with the development of international standards that ensure the safety and efficacy of technology for people with disabilities, as well as practical wheelchair development projects in Central America, Thailand, and Georgia; local capacity for customized seating for children with disabilities in South America; and appropriate technology for landmine survivors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening world markets to US technology for people with disabilities is a win-win situation.&nbsp; For example, a wheelchair project led by a RESNA member who is a MacArthur Fellow has finally solved the problem that wheelchairs have with their front casters in rough terrain, by adapting street vendor cart wheels they discovered in Zimbabwe. When these US-led international designs reach the US market, it will benefit wheelchair riders in the US.</p>
<p>RESNA thanks those senators who voted in favor of the resolution, and it expresses deep regret at those senators who were not willing to take a stand on behalf of all people with disabilities. Many of the senators who rejected the Convention understand and support the use of appropriate technology by American citizens with disabilities, but perhaps they did not see the connection to daily functioning for other citizens of the world. We hope the Senate will again consider the Convention in the near future, and we urge its passage when it does. RESNA will be pleased to share data and stories about appropriate technology&rsquo;s impact for citizens internationally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CRT items are used by people with significant disabilities and require a&nbsp;broader range of services and specialized personnel than what is required for standard durable medical equipment&nbsp;(DME). A separate benefit category allows for unique coding, coverage, and payment rules and policies that address the unique situations of this subset of&nbsp;durable medical&nbsp;equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RESNA is a coalition member of the Independence through Enhancement of Medicare and Medicaid (ITEM) Coalition, which worked hard to get this bill introduced.&nbsp;Now comes the&nbsp;equally difficult part of getting support for the legislation and moving it forward.&nbsp;RESNA board member Gerry Dickerson was instrumental in helping to get Representative Crowley to introduce the bill.</p>

59261,RESNA supports separate complex rehabilitation benefit category for Medicare," MyHomePage, News, Press,",,Informational webinars on May 24 for advocates will offer next steps,05/14/2012 09:41 AM,05/14/2012,05/14/2012 09:41 AM,0,"<p><strong>H.R. 4378</strong> ""Ensuring Access to Quality&nbsp;Complex Rehabilitation Technology Act of 2012"" was introduced on April 18, 2012 in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman <br /> Joseph Crowley (D-NY).&nbsp; H.R. 4378&nbsp;would create a separate benefit category under Medicare for complex rehabilitation technology (CRT), which includes products such as complex rehabilitation power wheelchairs, highly configurable manual wheelchairs, adaptive seating and positioning systems, and other specialized equipment. RESNA board member Gerry Dickerson was instrumental in helping to get Representative Crowley to introduce the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRT items are used by people with significant disabilities and require a&nbsp;broader range of services and specialized personnel than what is required for standard durable medical equipment&nbsp;(DME). A separate benefit category allows for unique coding, coverage, and payment rules and policies that address the unique situations of this subset of&nbsp;durable medical&nbsp;equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now comes the&nbsp;equally difficult part of getting support and moving forward the legislation. RESNA is a member of the SBC (Separate Benefit Category) Steering Committee, along with NRRTS, NCART, United Spinal Association, AA Homecare and the Clinical Task Force. &nbsp;The SBC Committee is conducting an informational webinar for advocates, ""Getting Behind HR 4378 - the Complex Rehab Separate Benefit Category Legislation"" on Thursday, May 24 at 11:30AM ET and again at 4:30PM ET. The presentation will review the legislation, discuss advocacy steps and tools, and allow for questions and discussion.</p>

57582,RESNA issues position paper on Ultralight Manual Wheelchairs," MyHomePage, News,",,Paper highlights available research and best clinical practice for this assistive technology.,04/18/2012 08:47 AM,04/18/2012,04/18/2012 08:47 AM,0,"<p>RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, has issued a new position paper entitled &ldquo;The Application of Ultralight Manual Wheelchairs.&rdquo; The purpose of the position paper is to document available research and best clinical practice to assist practitioners in supporting the appropriate application of fully customizable manual wheelchairs. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment related to specific client needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed through RESNA&rsquo;s Special Interest Group on Seating and Wheeled Mobility, the paper highlights, among other things, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wheelchairs should conform to the individual and not the individual to the chair;</li>
<li>Wheelchairs should be as lightweight as possible while also being fully adjustable to meet the individual&rsquo;s needs; and</li>
<li>Wheelchairs that are lightweight and adjustable cause the least amount of injury to users and increase functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper does not comment on the use of specific materials in wheelchairs, but does provide a definition of &ldquo;ultralight&rdquo; based on current scientific literature and Medicare policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practitioners find RESNA position papers useful because they directly address today&rsquo;s key issues, in this case surrounding the design, configuration, and application of wheelchairs,&rdquo; explained co-author Carmen DiGiovine, PhD, RET, ATP. &ldquo;By combining information about available research and best clinical practice, the paper provides a reference for practitioners to justify and support recommendations for the most appropriate equipment for clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a practicing clinician, I find RESNA position papers very useful.&nbsp; They assist me in justifying the assistive technology that best suits my clients&rsquo; needs,&rdquo; said co-author Lauren Rosen, PT, MTP, MSMS, ATP/SMS. &ldquo;These papers do not take the place of a clinician&rsquo;s judgment, but help to support it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RESNA regularly publishes position papers and guides on assistive technology via an established and rigorous developmental and review process. Besides &ldquo;The Application of Ultralight Manual Wheelchairs,&rdquo; other position papers and resources available on the website for free include:</p>
<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Application of Pediatric Power<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li>
<li>The Application of Seat Elevating Devices</li>
<li>The Application of Tilt, Recline, and Elevating Legrests for Wheelchairs</li>
<li>The Application of Wheelchair Standing Devices</li>
<li>Wheelchairs Used as Seats in Motor Vehicles</li>
<li>Wheelchair Service Provision Guide</li>
</ul>
<p><span>
<p>In addition to DiGiovine and Rosen, the current paper is the work of six authors including Theresa Berner (OTR/L, ATP), Kendra Betz (MPT, ATP), Tina Roesler (PT, MS, ABDA) and Mark Schmeler (PhD, OTR/L, ATP). The position paper is available for viewing and downloading on the RESNA website <a href=""http://www.resna.org/resources/position_papers.dot"">by clicking here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper will be submitted to the <i>Assistive Technology </i>Journal for publication later this year.&nbsp;</p>

55594,Announcing Enhanced ATP Certification Eligibility Requirements," MyHomePage, News, Press,",,"As of April 1, 2012, master's and bachelor's degrees in special education,rehabilitation science called out; work experience modified.",03/19/2012 09:28 AM,03/19/2012,03/19/2012 09:28 AM,0,"<p>ARLINGTON, VA &ndash; RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering &amp; Assistive Technology Society of North America, announced today that eligibility requirements for the Assistive Technology Professional (ATP) exam certification have been enhanced to better recognize candidates with master&rsquo;s and bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in special education.&nbsp; In addition, work experience has been modified to focus on actual hours worked, and professional training requirements are now included for certain degrees. The enhanced &nbsp;requirements go into effect April 1, 2012.&nbsp; Current candidates who have already been deemed eligible to take the exam are not affected, and there are no changes for those currently holding ATP certification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Assistive Technology Professional (ATP) Certification is offered only by RESNA, and over 7,000 assistive technology professionals have taken the exam. ATP certification is a clear way to identify professionals who have expertise in helping people with disabilities identify the proper assistive technology to meet their needs. ATP certification recognizes professionals who have reached an internationally accepted standard of knowledge in assistive technology, and promote RESNA&rsquo;s code of ethics and highest ethical standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;RESNA&rsquo;s Professional Standards Board, which is charged with oversight of the certification program, continuously evaluates the program to keep pace with changes in assistive technology, work practice, and the industry, &ldquo; explained Carmen DiGiovine, Ph D, ATP, RET and board chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pre-service AT training is now included in Master&rsquo;s level degrees within the rehabilitation sciences, and so we adjusted the work experience requirements to better reflect that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result, less work experience is now required for those with &nbsp;Master&rsquo;s level degrees in rehabilitation science, essentially one year of work experience at 0.5 FTE, rather than 2 years at 0.5 FTE. In addition, work experience is now expressed as hours worked rather than the number of years at full or part-time. &ldquo;We now focus on work experience as hours dedicated to the provision of assistive technology service delivery, as we felt that was more reflective of the knowledge and skills required in AT,&rdquo; said DiGiovine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These changes also recognize educators with master&rsquo;s and bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in special education, because they help children with their assistive technology needs in the school setting,&rdquo; confirmed Professional Standards Board member Dan Cochrane, ATP and an Assistive Technology Specialist/Coordinator for an Illinois school district.</p>

<p>Previous eligibility requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did not      distinguish master&rsquo;s or bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in special education as a      different category from rehabilitation science degrees, making it unclear      whether a person with a special education degree was eligible. Those with      special education degrees have always been eligible. </li>
<li>Required those      with a high school diploma or GED to have training experience. The      Professional Standards Board has now added education/training experience for      individuals with a bachelor&rsquo;s or associate&rsquo;s degree in non-rehab science. </li>
<li>Calculated      work experience based on full-time, part-time, or quarter-time employment      (1.0 FTE, 0.5 FTE, 0.25 FTE) as part of a job description, which did not apply      to candidates who work an academic year. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Required      those with high school diplomas or GEDs to work 40 hours a week for 2 full      years to meet the eligibility requirement. Now the requirement has been      raised to 6,000 hours, but it may be completed within 10 years to      accommodate those who are not working full-time providing AT services and      those who work in a school setting. </li>
</ul>

These programs are funded under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as amended and administered by the Rehabilitation Services Administration at the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These programs provide technology-related services to assist individuals with disabilities of all ages to access and obtain assistive technology (AT).&nbsp; People with disabilities use assistive technology in their daily lives to live independently, go to school or work, and participate in family and community life. Assistive technology covers a wide range of products and devices, and can be low-tech, like canes and grabbers, or high-tech, like eye-gaze systems that allow users to work on computers. Wheelchairs, hearing aids, speech-generating devices and speech recognition devices, and screen readers are common examples of assistive technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace has dedicated over 20 years working in the field as the Executive Director of the Assistive Technology Loan Fund Authority, Virginia&rsquo;s low interest loan program for assistive technology, and as a Policy and Funding Specialist for the Virginia Statewide Assistive Technology Program (VATS).&nbsp; Dr. Wallace has a variety of work experiences including case management, residential services, advocacy, policy development and teaching. He is the author of multiple journal articles, textbook chapters, and topic papers in numerous disability-related areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Joey is committed to increasing individual access to technology-related services through personal choice and self-advocacy,&rdquo; said M. Nell Bailey, Executive Director of RESNA. &ldquo;Having worked in these types of programs himself, he has an understanding and expertise that will be extremely valuable to everyone involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the people working in the programs that the RESNA Catalyst Project serves are valued colleagues and friends,&rdquo; said Wallace. &ldquo;This is an opportunity to support their great work and advocacy on behalf of their customers, and make sure that people have access to the technology they need to live independent lives in the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wallace received his PhD in Urban Services Leadership from Virginia Commonwealth University, a master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling from the University of Southern Maine, and a bachelor's degree in English from Boston  College. He lives in Richmond, VA with his wife Jeanne and their loyal dog Snoopy and has two sons, Sam and James.</p>

60911,Mobility Management magazine highlights RESNA position paper," MyHomePage, News, Press,",,RESNA's position paper on ultralight manual wheelchairs is featured in the June issue.,06/04/2012 11:34 AM,06/04/2012,06/04/2012 11:34 AM,0,"<p><i><a href=""http://mobilitymgmt.com/articles/2012/06/01/resna-position-paper.aspx"">Mobility Management</a></i>, a trade industry magazine serving the seating &amp; mobility professional, highlights RESNA's new position paper on ""<a href=""http://www.resna.org/resources/position_papers.dot"">The Application of Ultralight Manual Wheelchairs</a>"" in the June 2012 issue. The magazine interviewed RESNA volunteer and paper co-author Lauren Rosen, PT, MPT, MSMS, ATP/SMS. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.resna.org/resources/position_papers.dot"">The Application of Ultralight Manual Wheelchairs</a> is the latest of several seating &amp; mobility-oriented position papers that RESNA has published. In addition to Rosen, the paper's authors are Carmen DiGiovine, PhD, RET, ATP; Theresa Berner, OTR/L, ATP; Kendra Betz, MPT, ATP; Tina Roesler, PT, MS, ABDA; and Mark Schmeler, PhD, OTR/L, ATP.</p>
<p>The purpose of the position paper is to document available research and best clinical practice to assist practitioners in supporting the appropriate application of fully customizable manual wheelchairs. Developed through RESNA's Special Interest Group on Seating and Wheeled Mobility, the paper highlights, among other things that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wheelchairs should conform to the individual and not the individual to the chair;</li>
<li>Wheelchairs should be as lightweight as possible while also being fully adjustable to meet the individual's needs; and</li>
<li>Wheelchairs that are lightweight and adjustable cause the least amount of injury to users and increase functionality.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

Co-sponsored and coordinated by RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, the summit featured key speakers and over 40 senior-level professionals working in the field who convened for a three day meeting, held November 28 &ndash; November 30<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; Other sponsors included the Institute for Economic Empowerment of NISH and the ASME Bioengineering Division.&nbsp; The United States Access Board provided the space for the meeting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Rehabilitation Engineering Summit was coordinated by Jerry Weisman, MSME, ATP, RET,<b> </b>owner and principal of Rehabilitation Technology Services, a rehabilitation engineering consulting firm, and President of RESNA.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&ldquo;I felt that after 35 years, the timing was right to hold another summit,&rdquo; said Weisman, &ldquo;With new opportunities due to advancing technologies and the aging population, the field has more potential than ever. We want to make sure that rehab engineers are ready for the future and can continue to find common sense solutions to help people in their daily lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Featured speakers presented on the latest trends in research, service delivery, and education.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Reactor panels and breakout groups offered plenty of opportunity for feedback and brainstorming.
